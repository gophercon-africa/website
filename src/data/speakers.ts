    talkDescription: 'Acceptance criteria define the value a software delivers, but how can we ensure they\'re consistently understood, automated, and verified across teams? In this session, we\'ll explore how Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) bridges the gap between business expectations and technical implementation for Go teams. Using GoDog, an open-source Cucumber-style framework for Go, we\'ll show how to transform human-readable acceptance criteria into executable tests that live alongside your code. You\'ll learn how to write clear Gherkin scenarios, connect them to Go step definitions, and build a living documentation system that evolves with your project. Whether you\'re new to BDD or looking to improve collaboration between product owners, testers, and developers, this talk will empower you to automate what truly matters: delivering real business value with confidence.',
